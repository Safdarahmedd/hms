# Heath Monitoring System

This is an IoT smart band-based health monitoring app that allows users to track nutritional intake and breaks down meals by macro-nutrients. The aim is to provide the users a fun and holistic approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle with behavioural therapy, implementing elements of widely used fitness tracking apps like calorie counting, exercise tracking, daily water and medicine reminders and sleep tracking which have been found to be more effective and affordable than traditional coach/dietician methods as this requires very little upfront commitment and provides incentives to keep going.
